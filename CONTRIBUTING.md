# Contributing Guide For the Heroku VSCode Extension

This page lists the operational governance model of this project, as well as the recommendations and requirements for how to best contribute to Heroku VSCode Extension. We strive to obey these as best as possible. As always, thanks for contributing â€“ we hope these guidelines make it easier and shed some light on our approach and processes.

## Community Based

The intent and goal of open sourcing this project is to increase the user base. The governance model is one where new project leads (`admins`) will be added to the project based on their contributions and efforts, a so-called "do-acracy" or "meritocracy" similar to that used by all Apache Software Foundation projects.
